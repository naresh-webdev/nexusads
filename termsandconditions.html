                Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our web
                site. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
                used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
                only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of
                cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
                server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps
                Nexus Ad agency to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
                recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you
                return to the same Nexus Ad agency website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
                you can easily use the features that you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows
                the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web
                page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the
                IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web
                beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as
                part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web
                beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the web site or to monitor how our users navigate the web
                site, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were
                actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.
                Third party vendors also may use cookies on our web site. For instance, we may contract with third
                parties who will use cookies on our web site to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical
                information from our visitors and members. Such information is shared externally only on an anonymous,
                aggregated basis. These third parties use persistent cookies to help us to improve the visitor
                experience, to manage our site content, and to track visitor behaviour. We may also contract with a
                third party to send e-mail to our registered [users/members].

                To help measure and improve the effectiveness of our e-mail communications, the third party sets
                cookies. All data collected by this third party on behalf of Nexus Ad Agency is used solely by or on
                behalf of Nexus Ad Agency and is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. From time to
                time we may allow third parties to post advertisements on our web site, and those third-party
                advertisements may include a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. This Privacy Policy does
                not cover the use of information collected from you by third party ad servers. We do not control cookies
                in such third party ads, and you should check the privacy policies of those advertisers and/or ad
                services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology before linking to an ad. We will not
                share your personal information with these companies, but these companies may use information about your
                visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about
                goods and services that may be of interest to you, and they may share your personal information that you
                provide to them with others.

                You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
                you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
                cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Nexus Ad Agency
